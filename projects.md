## ü§ù Industry Collaboration

### I. Flexible Lubricator Handling & Inspection Platform  
**Department:** Mechanical Engineering (SJTU) ¬∑ Industry collaboration with Well Master Corporation  
**Role:** Lead Mechanical Designer  
_A modular 5‚ÄëDOF gantry lifts ~200‚Äëlb lubricators, reorients them horizontally to vertically, and enables inspection via real-time object detection; validated by a 2:1 prototype using CAD/FEA and multi-actuator fuzzy PID._

  <summary><strong>Expand for details</strong></summary>

**Goal.**  
Develop a production-ready system to automate the extraction, flipping, and inspection of lubricators stored in bulk shipping crates. The solution must be mechanically robust, operator-safe, and capable of integrating with an intelligent vision system to replace manual handling.

**Design & Methods.**  
- **Mechanical system:**  
  Designed a modular 5‚ÄëDOF cantilever gantry using aluminum profiles and custom brackets; verified critical joints and beams with ANSYS static analysis and modal simulation to ensure <1 mm deflection under load.  
  The flipping mechanism uses a torque-matched motorized platform with lateral stabilizers to maintain balance during rotation.  
  The flexible gripper combines compliant silicone pads with passive alignment geometry to accommodate shape variance in lubricators.

- **Control architecture:**  
  Implemented multi-actuator coordination using fuzzy PID (for Z-axis deceleration and gripper soft-landing) and coupled PID (for synchronized gantry motion). Safety interlocks prevent flipping when out-of-alignment or over-torque is detected.

- **Perception system:**  
  Integrated YOLOv11-based object detection to locate visual inspection regions (e.g. ports, labels, connector points) and to automatically trigger pass/fail decisions. Data is logged for traceability.

**Results / Metrics.**  
- Built and tested a 2:1 prototype demonstrating successful lifting and flipping with high repeatability.  
- **Structure:** FEA confirmed maximum deflection < 0.7 mm under 100 N equivalent load; modal frequency > 25 Hz avoids vibration.  
- **Control:** Flipping stability achieved with <3¬∞ overshoot and <2.5 s settle time.  
- **Perception:** Real-time inference (25 FPS) with >92% detection accuracy on known components; integrated inspection pass/fail logic.  
- **Throughput:** Task cycle time reduced by ~40% compared to manual workflow.  
- Delivered CAD package, electrical/control schematic, and final report to Well Master Corp.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary><strong>Expand for details</strong></summary>

**Goal.**  
Develop a wearable, comfortable, and testable actuation module for single-finger motion assistance. The design must minimize bulk, ensure safe force transmission, and enable future EMG-based control.

**Design & Methods.**  
- **Mechanical design:** Iterative CAD packaging for finger linkage, actuation cable routing, and palm-mounted motor housing. Focused on low-profile layout and mechanical safety (e.g. finger stops, soft returns).  
- **Actuation system:** Embedded control using Arduino-compatible microcontroller, motor driver, and feedback loop. Used mini DC gearmotor with Bowden-cable routing for tendon mimicry.  
- **EMG integration (exploratory):** Bench-tested surface EMG preprocessing and activation thresholds using MyoWare sensors to explore user-intent-based triggering logic.  
- **Ergonomics:** Conducted comfort trials with 4 participants; quick-release Velcro glove mount for easy donning/doffing; adjustable tension and actuation limits.

**Results / Metrics.**  
- Functional finger flex/extend motion over ~60¬∞ ROM with <5 mm lateral shift from neutral position.  
- Actuation latency ~180 ms from command trigger; peak torque transmission up to 0.18 Nm.  
- Passive return achieved via spring-guided neutral restoration; user safety enhanced with mechanical stops.  
- Feedback from user tests guided improvements to comfort, strap interface, and routing constraints.  
- Final design informs upcoming multi-finger exoskeleton framework.  
- **A machine-learning-based decoder for EMG intent detection is currently under development** to support multi-modal, user-adaptive control strategies.
