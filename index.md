# 👋 Hi, I'm Iris Tang

I’m a Mechanical Engineering master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University with a strong foundation in robotics, intelligent systems, and mechatronic design. I specialize in building full-stack engineering solutions — from CAD design and structural simulation to embedded control and AI integration.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that highlight my technical capabilities, research experience, and passion for solving real-world problems through innovative mechanical systems. Projects range from collaborative robotic arms and self-leveling tripods to wave-dampening devices and vision-driven manipulators, many of which have been prototyped, published, or patented.

> Feel free to explore the projects below — each includes a summary, technical highlights, and visuals.

# Thesis & Research Projects

This section highlights my academic research and thesis-related work, focusing on interdisciplinary mechanical systems that integrate structural design, control algorithms, and intelligent sensing. Many of these projects were conducted under faculty supervision or as part of research labs, and involve hands-on prototyping, simulations, and early-stage AI applications. The work reflects both deep technical investigation and practical engineering execution.

## Hand Exoskeleton

**Institution:** Carnegie Mellon University  
**Role:** Research Assistant (Sep 2024 – Present)  
**Tools:** SolidWorks · EMG Sensors · OpenCV · Arduino · Python (Supervised Learning Models)

#### 🔍 Overview
This research project aims to develop an intelligent hand exoskeleton system for spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, enabling motion assistance and rehabilitation through sensor-driven control. The device is designed to actuate not only individual fingers but also the wrist, supporting full-hand movement. Surface EMG sensors placed on the forearm detect muscle activity, while a vision-based system tracks real hand motion to provide training data.
