# 👋 Hi, I'm Iris Tang

I’m a Mechanical Engineering master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University with a strong foundation in robotics, intelligent systems, and mechatronic design. I specialize in building full-stack engineering solutions — from CAD design and structural simulation to embedded control and AI integration.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that highlight my technical capabilities, research experience, and passion for solving real-world problems through innovative mechanical systems.
