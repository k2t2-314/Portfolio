# 👋 Hi, I'm Iris Tang

I’m a Mechanical Engineering master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University with a strong foundation in robotics, intelligent systems, and mechatronic design. I specialize in building full-stack engineering solutions — from CAD design and structural simulation to embedded control and AI integration.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that highlight my technical capabilities, research experience, and passion for solving real-world problems through innovative mechanical systems. Projects range from collaborative robotic arms and self-leveling tripods to wave-dampening devices and vision-driven manipulators, many of which have been prototyped, published, or patented.

> Feel free to explore the projects below
