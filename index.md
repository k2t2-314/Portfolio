# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Iris Tang

Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineering masterâ€™s student at Carnegie Mellon University with a strong foundation in robotics, intelligent systems, and mechatronic design. I specialize in building full-stack engineering solutions â€” from CAD design and structural simulation to embedded control and AI integration.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that highlight my technical capabilities, research experience, and passion for solving real-world problems through innovative mechanical systems. Projects range from collaborative robotic arms and self-leveling tripods to wave-dampening devices and vision-driven manipulators, many of which have been prototyped, published, or patented.

# Thesis & Research Projects

This section highlights my academic research and thesis-related work, focusing on interdisciplinary mechanical systems that integrate structural design, control algorithms, and intelligent sensing. Many of these projects were conducted under faculty supervision or as part of research labs, and involve hands-on prototyping, simulations, and early-stage AI applications. The work reflects both deep technical investigation and practical engineering execution.

## Hand Exoskeleton

**Institution:** Carnegie Mellon University  
**Role:** Research Assistant (Sep 2024 â€“ Present)  
**Tools:** SolidWorks Â· EMG Sensors Â· OpenCV Â· Arduino Â· Python (Supervised Learning Models)

#### Overview
This research project aims to develop an intelligent hand exoskeleton system for spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, enabling motion assistance and rehabilitation through sensor-driven control. The device is designed to actuate not only individual fingers but also the wrist, supporting full-hand movement. Surface EMG sensors placed on the forearm detect muscle activity, while a vision-based system tracks real hand motion to provide training data.

#### My Contributions
As a core member of the team, I was responsible for:
- Designing and prototyping the finger actuation system using compact motors and custom joint geometry, optimized for natural range of motion (â€“30Â° to +80Â°)
- Implementing a computer vision pipeline to track fingertip trajectories using 2D video data
- Developing supervised learning models (classification and regression) to predict intended motion from EMG and visual inputs
- Preparing the pipeline for eventual real-time control integration
Other team members supported motor smoothing algorithms, mechanical integration for the wrist module, and hardware testing on volunteers.

#### Outcome
The prototype demonstrated ergonomic compliance and mechanical reliability during user testing on both healthy individuals and one SCI patient. Initial model training showed promising performance in motion intention prediction, establishing a foundation for adaptive, sensor-driven control in future iterations.

 - Validated system via prototype fabrication and controlled wave tank testing, achieving ~70% wave height reduction and ~85% energy attenuation.

#### Outcome
The system achieved ~70% wave height reduction and ~85% energy attenuation in field tests. The modular design enables rapid deployment, convenient transport, and easy depth customization â€” making it suitable for offshore platforms, environmental buoys, or underwater operations requiring a calm local water surface.

# Industry Collaboration Project

#### Outcome
The system achieved stable and efficient handling of multiple lubricator types, with precise motion control and consistent flipping accuracy. It was presented at SJTUâ€™s online exhibition, earning recognition for best project demonstration. This work laid the foundation for potential industrial deployment and IP filing.
