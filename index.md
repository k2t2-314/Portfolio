# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Iris Tang

Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineering masterâ€™s student at Carnegie Mellon University with a strong foundation in robotics, intelligent systems, and mechatronic design. I specialize in building full-stack engineering solutions â€” from CAD design and structural simulation to embedded control and AI integration.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that highlight my technical capabilities, research experience, and passion for solving real-world problems through innovative mechanical systems. Projects range from collaborative robotic arms and self-leveling tripods to wave-dampening devices and vision-driven manipulators, many of which have been prototyped, published, or patented.

> Feel free to explore the projects below â€” each includes a summary, technical highlights, and visuals.

# Thesis & Research Projects

This section highlights my academic research and thesis-related work, focusing on interdisciplinary mechanical systems that integrate structural design, control algorithms, and intelligent sensing. Many of these projects were conducted under faculty supervision or as part of research labs, and involve hands-on prototyping, simulations, and early-stage AI applications. The work reflects both deep technical investigation and practical engineering execution.
